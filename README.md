# RabbitFlip
- This is a game inspired by our childhood memory game. For some reason i was only allowed to play the memory game or minecraft till i was 12. This is a simple memory game where you have to match the picture cards.

# Features
- The colors used is mainly different shades of pink or peach.
- The theme was based around rabbits/bunny. (U ask why? - i just love them)
- I even provided the instructions for the first two rounds if someone was living under the rock.
- Round 3 works a little different so i also provided instructions for that on -rule.html.
- The pngs are mainly used for the background.
- I did use png in rule.html and instruction.html.
- There is a congratulatery pop up which appears when you win 
- A pop is also there when the time runs out
- On whole this website is very easy to use 

# How to use
- On landing page there are two buttons, if you do not know how to play the game then you can click on how to ply button.
- After you understood the instructions, click on start/play.
- After you clear Round-1 and Round-2 a set of rules/instructions for Round 3 will be displayed.
- The game is easy and you must have played it atleast once in your life.
